## Installation Guide

It is recommended to use a python virtual environment or conda environment to manage all python packages and projects. If you are a new Python user, installing and managing Python packages can be complicated. We recommend using a package management software such as [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). We refer the user elsewhere to make further installation decisions about Python packages in general. 

### Beginning users

On all of Windows, macOS, and Linux:

- Install Anaconda (it installs all packages you need and all other tools mentioned below).
- Utilize the Anaconda App to manage environments and package downloads.

### Advanced users (recommended method)

**Conda**

- Create a conda environment specifically for the task or project youâ€™re working on.

```
# Best practice, use an environment rather than install in the base env
conda create -n my-env python=3.10
conda activate my-env
# install library
conda install sdsu_comptox::danrerlib
```

**pip**

- create a python virtual environment for the task or project you are working on. 

```
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .
mkdir src
# Activate virtual environment and install
cd bin
source activate
pip install danrerlib
```
